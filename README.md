# Jam-Es.com

This repository contains the source code for the [Jam-Es.com](https://jam-es.com) website.

## Links

The site was largely written from scratch:  
- I used a basic CSS framework by Nespero called Fluent Kit (which is no longer available).
- The animated mesh-like particle system in the first section of the page is a modified version of my [JavaScript Snow Effect](https://github.com/James231/JavaScript-Snow-Effect).  
- I also used [Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/)  
- And the contact form backend works using Google Apps Script. See [this post](https://blog.jam-es.com/2019/12/google-apps-script-introduction-with.html) for more info.
- The contact form also uses Google's [reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html).
- Hosted by GitHub Pages (previously used GCP).
